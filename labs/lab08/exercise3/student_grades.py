 # set grade values

grade1 = 78
grade2 = 85 
grade3 = 92
grade4 = 67
grade5 = 88

 # calculation
  
total_points = grade1 + grade2 + grade3 + grade4 + grade5
average_score = ( grade1 + grade2 + grade3 + grade4 + grade5 ) / 5

 # contribution to percentage

grade1p = grade1 / 5
grade2p = grade2 / 5
grade3p = grade3 / 5
grade4p = grade4 / 5
grade5p = grade5 / 5

 # calculate how many points above or below the class average of 80 the student performed

grade1l = 78 -80
grade2l = 85 -80
grade3l = 92 -80
grade4l = 67 -80
grade5l = 88 -80
